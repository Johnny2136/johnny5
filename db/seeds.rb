# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#contacts = contacts.create([{name: "Jenny Doe"},{name: "Joe France"},{name: "James Bond"}])


#contacts =  Contact.create([{ name: "Jenny Doe"}, {phone: "8675309"}, {description: "Missing person"},{email: "JennyD@msn.com"}])
#  [ "Joe France", "6544737" , "Missing person","JoeF@msn.com"],
#  [ "James Bond", "1083990" , "Secret Agent","JamesB@msn.com"],
#  [ "Arther Dent", "4242424" , "Galactic Hitch hiker","ArtherD@msn.com" ],
#  [ "Zaphod Beeblebrox", "1111111" , "President of the Galaxy"," ZaphodB@msn.com" ],
